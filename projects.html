        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some personal and course projects I've been up to!</p>
        <h2>Hierarchial Video Prediction</h2>
        <p> Code reimplementation of paper by Villegas at al. Github repo of my work found with working code, cool gifs, and pdf write-up of personal experimentation found <a href='https://github.com/ZhongxiaYan/video_prediction'>here</a>  </p> 
        <h2>Behavioral Learning with DQNs and Flappy Bird</h2>
        <p>Playing around with some reinforcement learning methods and trained a behavioral learning agent on a dqn agent playing flappy bird. What you'll notice is that despite being trained on the dqn, the behavioral learning agent does better by regularizing out the irregular movements of the dqn agent! Project page and code coming really soon.</p>
        <h2>Mean Faces</h2>
        <p>What defines the features of different demographics such as age, ethnicity, or gender? Often, it's hard to pinpoint the exact features that define such demographics. By averaging out several people of the same demographic, the most prominent features become more apparent. Here is work showing the different "average" faces of different demographics! 
          <!-- <a href="faces.html"> project page </a></p> -->
        <h2>Image Manipulation and Computataional Photography Projects</h2>
        <p>The course that inspired me to start computer vision. CS194-26 is taught by Prof. Alexei Efros and was the course that started my journey down computer vision and machine learning. The projects we did in the class were some of my most rewarding projects at Berkeley. <a href="194.html"> project page </a></p>
